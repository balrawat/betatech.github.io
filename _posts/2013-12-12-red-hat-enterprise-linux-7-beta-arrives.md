Red Hat yesterday announced the beta availability of its next-generation Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 operating system platform. The new beta marks the first major public milestone release of RHEL 7, which is the successor to the RHEL 6 platform that first debuted in 2010 and was most recently updated with the 6.5 release in November of this year.

"With today's announcement, we are inviting Red Hat customers, partners, and members of the public to provide feedback on what we believe is our most ambitious release to date. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is designed to provide the underpinning for future application architectures while and providing the flexibility, scalability, and performance needed to deploy across bare metal, virtual machines, and cloud infrastructure", says Red Hat.

The company further adds, "based on Fedora 19 and the upstream Linux 3.10 kernel, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 will provide users with powerful new capabilities that streamline and automate installation and deployment, simplify management, and enhance ease-of-use, all while delivering the stability that enterprises have come to expect from Red Hat".

One of the big changes coming in RHEL 7 is the move from Ext4 to XFS as the default file system. Ext4 and its predecessor Ext3 have long been the default file systems in Red Hat's Linux distributions. However, Pacheco said, across all industries, Red Hat's customers are dealing with a data explosion—which shouldn't surprise anyone involved in the technology industry given the buzz around big data. "This enormous data growth requires a scalable, performance file system, which is provided by XFS— hence the move to it as the default file system," company said. XFS can support systems of up to 500TB in size; in contrast, Ext4 scales to a maximum stand-alone file system of 50TB.
